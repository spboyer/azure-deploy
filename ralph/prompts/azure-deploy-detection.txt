Work in the current repo. Use these files as your source of truth:
- The PRD JSON file provided as context (do not assume its path)
- progress.txt

You are testing the DETECTION logic of the Azure Deploy Copilot Skill.

1. Find the highest-priority detection test (passes: false).
2. Navigate to the test scenario folder.
3. Analyze the project files to detect:
   - Application type (static, function, backend)
   - Framework (React, Vue, Flask, etc.)
   - Recommended Azure service
   - Confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
4. Compare detection result against expected outcome in the PRD.
5. If detection is wrong, fix the SKILL.md detection logic.
6. Update the PRD with passes: true if correct.
7. Append progress to progress.txt.
8. Git commit the changes.

ONLY WORK ON ONE TEST SCENARIO.
If all detection tests pass, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
