Work in the current repo. Use these files as your source of truth:
- The PRD JSON file provided as context (do not assume its path)
- progress.txt

You are testing and improving the Azure Deploy Copilot Skill (SKILL.md).

1. Find the highest-priority test scenario to work on (one that has passes: false).
2. Follow the test steps exactly:
   - For detection tests: Run the detection logic against the test scenario
   - For deployment tests: Deploy to Azure and validate via curl
3. If the test fails, analyze why and fix the skill or test scenario.
4. If the test passes, update the PRD with passes: true.
5. Append your progress to progress.txt.
6. Make a git commit of the changes.

IMPORTANT:
- Only work on ONE test scenario per iteration
- For Azure deployments, always clean up resources after validation
- Use centralus region for Static Web Apps (eastus not available)
- Validate deployments by curling the endpoint

If all tests pass, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
