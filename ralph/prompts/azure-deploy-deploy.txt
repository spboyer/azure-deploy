Work in the current repo. Use these files as your source of truth:
- The PRD JSON file provided as context (do not assume its path)
- progress.txt

You are testing ACTUAL DEPLOYMENTS of the Azure Deploy Copilot Skill.

1. Find the highest-priority deployment test (passes: false).
2. Check Azure CLI authentication (run `az login` if needed).
3. Create a unique resource group for this test.
4. Follow the deployment workflow in SKILL.md for the detected service type.
5. After deployment, validate by curling the endpoint:
   - For Static Web Apps: curl the default hostname
   - For App Service: curl https://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net
   - For Functions: curl https://<func-name>.azurewebsites.net/api/<function-name>
6. Clean up the Azure resource group.
7. If deployment succeeds and curl validates, mark passes: true.
8. If deployment fails, analyze and fix the SKILL.md guidance.
9. Append progress to progress.txt.
10. Git commit the changes.

IMPORTANT DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
- Use centralus, eastus2, or westus2 for Static Web Apps
- Use --javascript flag when publishing Node.js functions
- Build React/Vue apps before deploying (npm run build)
- Wait for App Service to start before curling

ONLY WORK ON ONE DEPLOYMENT TEST.
If all deployment tests pass, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
